title: Accessing your therapy room
---
The therapy room is where you meet with students to conduct services. Every SEP provider is given a unique link for their therapy room. This link can be shared with students to allow them to access your therapy room for sessions.

You can access your therapy room from the main navigation or from your dashboard. When you first enter your therapy room, your web browser will prompt you to approve access to your camera and microphone. Depending on your browser, you can choose to save these settings so you won't be prompted again.

After this is done, you should see yourself in your camera. This screen allows you to verify your devices are working properly. If you need to make any changes, click on the gear icon to bring up the device settings dialog.&#x20;

When you're ready, click "Continue to therapy room".

The therapy room is divided into three major sections:
